# üòä Before the workshop

To have a smooth experience during the workshop, please make sure that you follow a few simple suggestions. Pleae make sure that your environment is setup with the appropriate version of Node.js installed (more details in the [Setup](#-setup) section).

Please also make sure to have installed the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

And have an account with the following providers:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

On top of these please have your favourite code editor and terminal ready.

# üßÆ Setup

## Pre-requisites

- Please make sure to run the latest available [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (`v16.x.x`). (Use `node -v` to see the currently installed version)
- Install the project dependencies by executing `npm i` in your terminal.

## Gather your environment variables

Please login to your [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/login) account and note your `CLOUD_NAME`, and copy the `CLOUDINARY_URL` (API Environment variable) string.

## Clone the starter template from GitHub

We have created a starter template, which you can grab from GitHub by running the following command: `npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm --example https://github.com/!!!!!! XOXOXOXOX`

## Add your environment variables

- Create the following file at the root of the project:

  - `.env.local`

- Add the following content to `.env.local` replacing `...` with the values collected in the previous step. (Note that the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUD_NAME` should be your Cloudinary cloud name. Please also note that if copied automatically from the Cloudinary UI, the `CLOUDINARY_URL` prefix will also be copied, there's no need to add that twice)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_URL=...
```

## Run the setup script

**‚ö†Ô∏èPlease make sure that you DO NOT have a folder `imagecon` already under your account. If you do, please contact an instructor first before running the below setup script.‚ö†Ô∏è**

Once the environment variables have been set, please run `npm run setup` from the root of the project. This will setup all the necessary assets under your Cloudinary profile, into a folder called `imagecon`.

## Configure your Cloudinary account

Navigate to your Cloudinary account and find Settings -> Security.
Find the Resource List selector and uncheck the `restricted media types` checkbox.

## Create upload presets

Navigate to Settings -> Upload and find the upload preset section.

Create the following two presets:

```
preset name: imagecon-uw
signing mode: unsigned
folder: imagecon
```

Make sure to hit save after your edits.

Then, duplicate the `imagecon-uw` preset, rename the duplicate to `tag-as-coffee`. Edit its settings, find `Media Analysis and AI` and under `Tags` add `coffee`. Make sure to hit save after your edits.

## Starting the project

To start the project in development mode, please run `npm run dev` from the CLI.
